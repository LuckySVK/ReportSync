overrides:
  report_staff: false # Allow users to report staff members
  staff_report: false # Allow staff members to report users
  hide_reload: true
  # When a user tries to reload the config without having the permission, the plugin will not show the "error_no_permission" message
  # Instead, it will take it as a normal report and continue with the normal report function

# Secret uses: /report reload
# Use the reload command to reload the config
# If a player named "reload" is on the server, the plugin will detect it and do the report function instead reloading

# Permissions:
# reportsync.reload - Reload the config
# reportsync.report - Use the /report command
# reportsync.staff - Bypass and receive reports (Staff members only)
